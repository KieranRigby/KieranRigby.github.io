        <p>We live in a world of animal lovers, nobody (or at least very few people), say that they want to see pain inflicted on animals. Practically everyone agrees that animal cruelty is wrong and that those who are cruel to animals should be punished. This is why we have laws in place protecting the rights of animals, or at least certain animals.</p>

        <p>But how can a world of animal lovers be the same world that also believes that the
        deaths of over 70 billion land animals and as many as 2.7 trillion marine animals 1 2
        a year is not only acceptable, but actively support its continuance, believing it is
        morally justifiable?</p>

        <p>So can you love animals and eat them? The answer is no, of course you can’t,
        because the two ideas contradict one another. Saying you love animals whilst eating
        their bodies and secretions is like saying “of course I can love my child and beat
        them”. If an abusive parent said that they loved their child, but were also beating
        them we would think they were a psychopath. This demonstrates the disturbing and
        paradoxical ideologies we have as a collective society of ‘animal lovers’ who are in
        fact animal eaters.</p>

        <p>To put this another way, if you love someone the last thing you want to happen to
        them is for them to be forcibly impregnated, tortured, murdered and eaten, let alone
        pay for these things to happen to them. If you love someone then you want to avoid
        bad things happening to them at all costs, so if you love animals then by default the
        last thing you would ever want is to see their murdered body parts on a plate in front
        of you.</p>

        <p>This can even be put in simpler terms. If you are talking to a non-vegan and they
        have a companion animal such as a dog, ask them if it would be possible to claim
        that they loved their dog if they mutilated and murdered them.</p>

        <p>To be a lover of animals is to love, respect and show compassion to them, all of
        them, not just the ones society tells us to love. To truly be an animal lover, we have to
        acknowledge that all animals are worthy of life and deserve to live their life free from
        human oppression.</p>

        <p>When someone who eats animal products claims to be an animal lover, simply say
        “can you really be an animal lover if you pay for animals to be hurt?” - chances are
        they’ve never thought about their relationship with animals in this way before.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-section" id="question-2" data-question="Eating animal products is my personal choice" data-bg="chicken.jpg">
        <p>“Respect my opinion! It's my personal choice to eat meat, don't force your views
        on to me!” - of all the excuses used to defend eating animal products, this could well
        be the most common. So is eating animals a personal choice, or is it more complex
        than that?</p>

        <p>This is quite an interesting excuse as arguably it is a choice, however using this logic
        it would also be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal
        choice to do so.</p>

        <p>In this situation ask the person, “if someone makes the personal choice to abuse a
        dog, does that make it morally justifiable?”.</p>

        <p>This argument perfectly demonstrates our detachment from the fact that animal
        products came from a living being. As a society we hold animals with such little
        regard that we don't consider their lives worthy of consideration, thinking of the
        consumption of animal products in a way that only affects us as individuals.</p>

        <p>As vegans, we are often met with “you should respect my personal choice”.
        However, vegans do respect the personal choice of others. We respect the choice of
        the animals who are exploited and treated as nothing other than a disposable
        commodity.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we respect the views of the humans who are also victims within the
        systems of animal exploitation - and we even respect the view of the person we are
        talking to, the view that they probably want to live a long life by caring enough to tell
        them that consuming animal products hugely increases their risk of cancer, diabetes,
        strokes, dementia, heart disease and many other major diseases plaguing our
        species.</p>

        <p>So when people so defiantly tell us to respect the views of others, the question is,
        which other view point are they considering other than their own?</p>

        <p>It is not morally justifiable to murder just because the murderer personally made the
        choice to murder. It is not morally justifiable to kick and beat a dog just because the
        abuser personally made the choice to kick and beat the dog, and it is not morally
        justifiable to pay for animals to be exploited and killed, just because we can make
        the choice to pay for animals to be exploited and killed.</p>

        <p>When someone uses the “my personal choice” argument, simply ask them, “what
        about the personal choice of the animal?”</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section" id="question-3" data-question="I like the taste & I couldn't give it up" data-bg="pig.jpg">
        <p>When it boils down to it, the number one reason people eat animal products is  because they enjoy the taste - I know I certainly did, in fact like most people I loved  the taste of animal products. I think one of the most disconcerting things about the  taste excuse though, is that it is an excuse that bluntly admits that the personal desires  of an individual matter more than the moral concerns surrounding an animal’s life  and unquestionably horrific death.</p>

        <p>However, it doesn’t mean that the person using this excuse necessarily believes that  their taste preferences are more important than an animal’s life (most people I talk to  don’t), but because they’ve never been asked about it before they’ve never had to  confront the fact that through their actions they are placing their taste higher. This is  why when people say to me, “I love the taste of meat” or, “I could never give up  cheese” I like to ask them, “do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an  animal?” - most people will say no, but if they do say yes make sure to ask them why. </p>
        <p>One of the big issues with this excuse is that it seeks to validate a non-vegan diet by  claiming that we shouldn’t be held responsible for our immoral consumer habits  because our sensory impulses are too strong to be suppressed and as such, we can’t  be held morally accountable for the actions that we make. </p>
        <p>But where do we draw the line? Would this argument hold up in court if a murderer  in their own defence said, “but I could never give up murdering because I enjoy it  too much.”?  </p>
        <p>It requires more than sensory pleasure to morally justify something - and the  inconvenience people go through by giving up cheese, for example, is not even  remotely comparable to the pain a dairy cow goes through being forcibly  impregnated repeatedly, having her children taken away from her and being  pumped for her milk before she becomes too weak or old and is sent to be  slaughtered. </p>
        <p>I think one of the reasons why as vegans we find this excuse a really difficult one to  hear is because it doesn’t matter whatever product people claim they could never  give up or enjoy the taste of, the difficulty and the inconvenience that it would be for  them to no longer eat animal products is minuscule compared to the pain, suffering  and fear that the animals have to go through.  </p>
         <img src="~/assets/img/pig.jpg" />
        <p>A non-vegan meal lasts for 15 minutes, but the death of an animal is eternal. What  food could ever be worth taking the life of an individual? An individual that felt fear,  an individual that felt pain, an individual that felt confused and couldn’t understand  why such intolerable suffering was being forced upon them? </p>

        <p>The fear of death is not unique to humans. Most of us fear dying and hope it will  happen peacefully, surrounded by the ones we love without pain. The scariest thing  we can think of is being tortured and ultimately murdered. We make horror films  about this concept and it gives us nightmares. But this isn’t a horror film for the  trillions of animals that are slaughtered each year, it isn’t a nightmare that they will  wake from. It’s real, the pain, the fear, it is all real - and then they die and they are  gone forever.  </p>
        <p>We need only put ourselves in the position of the animals as they look up at the  human who’s about to murder them and imagine their fear and confusion to understand why taste can never justify this incomprehensible atrocity. When talking  to someone who uses the excuse of taste, try asking them the following questions: </p>
        <p>“Do you not think we require more than sensory pleasure alone to morally justify  an action?.  </p>
        <p>“Is it morally justifiable for someone to kill a dog if they like the taste?” </p>
        <p>“What is it about being human that means the life of an animal is lower than our  taste preferences?” </p>
        <p>“Do you think it is acceptable to inflict pain, suffering and death onto an animal  that wishes to avoid pain, suffering and death?” </p>
        <p>“If we would hate to be exploited and killed, is it not hypocritical for us to  exploit and kill others?” </p>
        <p>Also, it’s worth explaining that it’s not as if people even have to give up the flavours  of the animal products that they eat. There is now such a huge and varied selection  of vegan alternatives to cheese, milk, eggs and meats. Explain that as vegans we eat  burgers, hot dogs, burritos, nachos, lasagna, mac and cheese, curries, cheese pizza,  cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, ice cream and everything else in between.  </p>
        <p>Explain how as vegans we experience all of the flavours and textures that we used  to, except now they come from plants. No dead body parts, no gristle, no  cholesterol, no hormones, no antibiotics. It’s also really helpful to note where we can  get these products from, and which restaurants now have vegan menus and options.</p>
